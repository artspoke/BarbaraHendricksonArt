# Barbara Hendrickson Art Website

This is a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript artist portfolio website.

## Project Guidelines

- Keep the design clean, elegant, and minimal
- Prioritize image protection (no full-resolution downloads)
- Maintain responsive design for all screen sizes
- Use vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks required
- Follow the existing code style and naming conventions

## Gallery Data

The paintings data is stored in `js/gallery.js`. When adding new paintings:
- Use descriptive titles and accurate medium/dimensions
- Ensure images are web-optimized (1200-1600px, 80-85% quality)
- Include all metadata (title, medium, dimensions, year)

## Styling

- Colors and spacing are defined as CSS variables in `css/styles.css`
- Use the existing font stack (Cormorant Garamond for headings, Montserrat for body)
- Maintain the current elegant, gallery-like aesthetic
